	Great question! Here's a comparison of CTEs (Common Table Expressions) vs subqueries:

## CTE (Common Table Expression)

sql

```sql
WITH user_tweet_counts AS (
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(tweet_id) AS tweet_bucket
    FROM tweets
    WHERE YEAR(tweet_date) = 2022
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT tweet_bucket, COUNT(user_id) AS users_num
FROM user_tweet_counts
GROUP BY tweet_bucket;
```

## Subquery (Your Current Approach)

sql

```sql
SELECT tweet_bucket, COUNT(user_id) AS users_num
FROM (
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(tweet_id) AS tweet_bucket
    FROM tweets
    WHERE YEAR(tweet_date) = 2022
    GROUP BY user_id
) AS user_tweet_counts
GROUP BY tweet_bucket;
```

## Key Differences:

**Readability:**

- **CTE wins**: Separates logic clearly, reads top-to-bottom
- **Subquery**: Can get nested and harder to follow in complex queries

**Reusability:**

- **CTE wins**: Can reference the same CTE multiple times in one query
- **Subquery**: Must be rewritten if needed again

**Performance:**

- **Usually identical**: Most modern databases optimize them the same way
- **Database-specific**: Some databases may have slight preferences

**Debugging:**

- **CTE wins**: Easier to test the CTE portion independently
- **Subquery**: Harder to isolate and test parts

## When to Use Each:

**Use CTEs when:**

- Complex logic that benefits from step-by-step breakdown
- Need to reference the same derived table multiple times
- Want maximum readability
- Working with recursive queries

**Use Subqueries when:**

- Simple, one-off derived tables
- Quick inline calculations
- Following team/company coding standards that prefer them

For your specific case, both work equally well, but the CTE version might be slightly more readable!
