## Order Matters:

1. **Data Cleaning** (missing values, duplicates)
2. **Feature Engineering** (create new features)
3. **Encoding** (categorical variables)
4. **Train/Test Split** (prevent data leakage)
5. **Scaling** (fit on train, transform both train/test)
6. **Feature Selection** (optional)

**Key Rule**: Always fit preprocessing on training data only, then transform both train and test sets!
Also [[Sklearn Pipeline]] is generally used to tune and test several different combination of there data preprocessing and evaluation technique
