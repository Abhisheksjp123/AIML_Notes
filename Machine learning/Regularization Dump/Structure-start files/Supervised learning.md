Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. The key characteristic is that the training dataset contains both input features and the correct output labels, allowing the algorithm to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs.

Types of models:
1. [[Linear Models]]
2. [[Tree Based Models]]
3. [[Support vector machine(SVM)]]
4. [[Neural Network]]
5. [[Other Supervised Models]]
